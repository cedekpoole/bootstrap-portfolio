# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description 

Bootstrap is the most popular CSS framework for creating responsive and mobile-first websites. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates that you are able to customise yourself; we are given the ability to utilise prebuilt grid systems and components and incorporate a variety of JavaScript plugins into our projects (link to website is here: https://getbootstrap.com/). For my portfolio page, this framework has been used throughout and has had a significant impact on the design process in terms of speed and ease. 

For this project, I used Bootstrap v4.6 (click here to see my portfolio page: https://cedekpoole.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio/). For the navigation bar, I used a Bootstrap navbar component and then customised it myself to fit the theme of the page. In addition to this, the navbar also collapses once it reaches a certain screen width, opening up a hamburger menu instead. A very small bit of Javascript has been deployed to change the colour of the navbar once you scroll past a certain point.

The jumbotron - which can be found in the header of the page - utilises another bootstrap component. The grid system is also used at this point, and such a system has been employed for the rest of the elements on the page. Here, the title, profile picture and link to my resume can be found. After the jumbotron lies the 'Projects' section where customised bootstrap cards have been used to display my previous projects. In the first project card, there is a carousel that presents several images of that particular project. 

The 'About' section includes some personal information along with the technologies and skills I hope to know in the coming months. Following this is the footer, which contains all the information needed to contact me. Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) was used to incorporate the font 'Space Mono' onto the page, and Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/) provided me with a number of interesting icons that can be found throughout.
